# DevOps Capstone – Project Atlas

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end DevOps CI/CD pipeline using industry-standard tools and practices.

## Tools & Technologies
- Git & GitHub – Version Control
- Jenkins – Continuous Integration & Pipeline Automation
- Ansible – Infrastructure as Code (conceptual integration)
- CI/CD Pipelines – Build, Test, Deploy
- Rollback Strategy – Versioned deployments using symlinks

## Episodes Implemented

### Episode 1–3: Git Fundamentals
- Repository initialization
- Branching strategy
- Merge conflict creation and resolution

### Episode 4–5: Build Tools
- Maven project creation with unit tests
- Build artifact generation

### Episode 6–8: Jenkins Basics & Parameters
- Freestyle Jenkins jobs
- Git integration
- Parameterized builds for multiple environments

### Episode 9–10: Jenkins Pipeline & CI Testing
- Declarative Jenkinsfile
- Build, Test, Deploy stages
- Fail-fast pipeline behavior on test failure

### Episode 13: Jenkins + Ansible Integration
- Jenkins-controlled infrastructure changes
- Infrastructure as Code via Ansible playbooks
- Full audit trail using Jenkins build history

### Episode 14: Deployment & Rollback
- Versioned deployment directories
- Instant rollback using symlink switching

## Outcome
The project delivers a complete CI/CD pipeline with traceability, automation, governance, and rollback capability, following DevOps best practices.

## Metrics
DevOps performance can be measured using DORA metrics:
- Deployment Frequency
- Lead Time for Changes
- Change Failure Rate
- Mean Time to Recovery
